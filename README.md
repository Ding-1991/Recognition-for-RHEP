# Recognition-for-RHEP
This is a demo of RHEP behavior recognition  based on CNN.
RHEP is rough handling of express parcels in express services. 
A three-axis acceleration sensor is used to collect the acceleration data of the package, and then the features are extracted, and the features are arranged according to a certain method as the input of the CNN. CNN can intelligently identify whether the package is violently handled and the type of rough handling. For specific technical details, please refer to our paper. The link is: (to be updated).
This example is implemented by tflearn, and it is also very simple to implement with keras.
